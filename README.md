# SHHS-Football

The three of us designed this website for the football team at our high school. Each of us played from our freshman year to our senior year and wanted to give back to the program that gave us such a wonderful high school experience. Our school colors are black and gold, which is why we chose the color scheme that we used. Personally, I worked with more of the css side of the website, but I did work with the others on the actual code of the website. I am responsible for the pictures page and bits and peices of the other pages.
